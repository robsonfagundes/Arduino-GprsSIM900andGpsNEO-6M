# Where is my arduino? Arduino-GprsSIM900andGpsNEO-6M

This sketch code to get geolocation with SIM900 and send the coordinates to a API 
---------------
The following code show how to use an Arduino UNO with the GPRS+GPS(SIM900) shield to send GPS coordinates to a API through HTTP protocol. 
This example also serves to help other developers who are facing the same problem or a similar problem with Gprs SIM900 and Gps NEO-6M working together.

This code is the resolution for the issues that I made in stackoverflow:
